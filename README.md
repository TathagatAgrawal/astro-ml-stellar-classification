# Stellar Classification with MLP, SVC & Decision Trees

This repository contains code and documentation for a comparative study of three supervised learning models---Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and Decision Tree (DT)---applied to a six-class stellar classification problem. The mapping from stellar parameters (temperature, luminosity, radius, absolute magnitude, colour, spectral class) to class labels is automated, model performance is evaluated, and over-fitting behaviours are analysed.

For detailed methodology, experiments, and theoretical background, see the [Jupyter Notebook](star_type_model_comparison.ipynb) and the [full documentation](star_type_classification_documentation.pdf).
